# Using-Computer-Vision-Techniques-with-OpenCV-for-Lane-Detection-in-Autonomous-Vehicles

The purpose of this project is to develop a program that can identify lane markings in images or videos. While humans can use their eyes to determine the location of lane lines while driving, our vehicles lack this type of visual perception capability.

This is where computer vision comes into play, helping computers "see" through complex algorithms. By leveraging computer vision techniques with OpenCV, we can enable autonomous vehicles to detect lane markings effectively.

# Using-Computer-Vision-Techniques-with-OpenCV-for-Lane-Detection-in-Autonomous-Vehicles

The purpose of this project is to develop a program that can identify lane markings in images or videos. While humans can use their eyes to determine the location of lane lines while driving, our vehicles lack this type of visual perception capability.

This is where computer vision comes into play, helping computers "see" through complex algorithms. By leveraging computer vision techniques with OpenCV, we can enable autonomous vehicles to detect lane markings effectively.

### Grayscale Conversion

**Grayscale Conversion**

The purpose of edge detection is to identify the boundaries of objects within images. Essentially, I will use edge detection to find areas of sharpness in an image.

### Why Convert an Image to Grayscale?

Images are composed of pixels. A three-channel color image contains red, green, and blue channels. In a grayscale image, each pixel has only one channel and only one intensity value. The absence of color information means less data usage and simpler processing procedures.
